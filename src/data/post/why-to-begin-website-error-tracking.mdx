## Script errors
Usually caused by a bug in your code or a third-party script.
Every production deployment may introduce new script errors that you didn't catch in development.
FailWarn monitors your website and alerts you when they occur.

## Network errors
Network errors are usually caused by server issues or client-side network problems.
You may have an API that your website depends on, and when it goes down, your website will start throwing errors.

**In most cases your backend teams will be alerted, but your application may also use third-party APIs that you don't control.** 

Because FailWarn monitors your website from the client side, we can alert you when any of these errors occur.

## Track errors with 1 simple script
There are many tools available to monitor website errors, but none of them are as simple as FailWarn.

**Just copy and paste the script tag to your website and you're done.**

FailWarn will start monitoring your website for script and HTTP errors immediately.
1. <a href={loginPermalink}>Login</a> to your account and get the script tag from the dashboard.
2. Paste the script tag in your website **head** section.

That's it! FailWarn will start monitoring your website for errors.

## Set up alerts
We send an email when any new issue occurs on your website. You can setup additional email addresses to receive alerts.

Visit the dashboard and edit the project to set up alert thresholds.
You will receive an email alert when the error rate exceeds the alert threshold.
